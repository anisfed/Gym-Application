# Include python dependencies required to use your package on production
# A few definitions:
# - internal dependencies: internals are the ones we code ourselves @AXIONE.
# - external dependencies: well, the others.
# - main dependencies: the ones that we import and use on our python files.
# - strict versions: set by ==
# - ranged versions: set by <=A.B.C,>D.E.F
#
# Common rules
# - all deps required by tests must be added in test.txt not here.
# - all deps required by dev must be added in dev.txt not here.
# - all external main deps are versioned with strict versions.
# - all internal main deps are versioned with ranged versions for more flexibility: X.Y.Z.Aplha
#   The Alpha is the distance from the last release
#   Z is for an evolution that don't break
#   Y may break the behavior
#   X major refactoring/new version
#   and for internal, we need to have >=X.Y.0,<X.Y+1.0
